Painting with AI
# Building AI course project

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Painting with AI is a creative project that explores how artificial intelligence can be used as a supportive tool in the process of creating digital art. The goal of the project is not to replace human creativity, but to investigate how AI can assist, inspire, and lower the threshold for artistic expression. Many people are interested in painting and visual art but may feel limited by a lack of technical skills, experience, or confidence. This project aims to address that gap by allowing users to collaborate with AI during the creative process.

The idea behind Painting with AI is that users can provide simple inputs such as text descriptions, moods, color preferences, or rough sketches. Based on this input, the AI generates a digital painting or suggests visual variations that the user can further refine. In this way, the final artwork is created through interaction between the user and the AI, where the human remains in control of decisions and direction.

The project is intended for hobby artists, students, designers, and curious beginners who want to explore creativity in a low pressure and accessible way. It highlights how AI can function as a creative partner rather than an automated solution. By focusing on exploration and inspiration, Painting with AI demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be applied to creative and cultural domains, not only technical or commercial problems. This project was created as part of the Building AI course project.


## Background

Many people are interested in art and painting but feel limited by a lack of technical skills, materials, or confidence. Creative expression is often seen as something that requires years of training, which can discourage beginners from even trying. At the same time, digital creativity tools are becoming more common, but they can still feel complex or intimidating.

This project addresses the problem of accessibility in creative work. By using AI as a supportive tool, Painting with AI makes it easier for people to explore visual art without needing advanced skills. My personal motivation comes from an interest in creativity, design, and how technology can be used to support human expression rather than replace it. The topic is interesting because it shows how AI can be applied beyond efficiency and automation, into cultural and creative areas.


## How is it used?

The solution would be used through a simple digital interface, such as a web or mobile application. A user starts by describing what they want to create using text, choosing colors, moods, or uploading a rough sketch. The AI then generates a digital painting or visual suggestions based on this input.

The user can iterate on the result by adjusting the input or selecting variations. The tool is meant to be used in relaxed, creative situations, such as personal projects, studying, or inspiration sessions. Users may include hobby artists, students, designers, or people who want to experiment with art in an easy and accessible way.


## Data sources and AI methods
The project would rely on image data and text descriptions. Training data could consist of publicly available images of paintings and artworks, as well as labeled text describing artistic styles, colors, and moods. No personal data is required.
AI methods could include neural networks and generative models trained to recognize visual patterns and artistic styles. Natural language processing would be used to interpret user text input and connect it to visual features in the generated artwork.

## Challenges

The project does not guarantee high-quality or meaningful artwork in all cases. AI-generated images may lack emotional depth or originality, and results depend heavily on the training data. There are also ethical considerations related to copyright, artistic ownership, and how AI-generated art should be credited or shared. The project does not aim to replace artists or traditional art education.

## What next?
In the future, the project could be expanded with more advanced customization options, multiple artistic styles, and interactive editing tools. It could also grow into a fully developed application with user accounts and saved projects. Further development would require technical skills, more data, and collaboration with designers or artists.
